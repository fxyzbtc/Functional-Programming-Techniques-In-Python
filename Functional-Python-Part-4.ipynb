    "# General Suggestions for Migrating to FPT\n",
    "\n",
    "- Don't start forcing a FPT heavy design on existing repos or packages. Specifically for cases where you might be changing the public API of core libs of your application or stack. For example, migrating to heavily use [toolz](https://toolz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/streaming-analytics.html) might create too many impedence mismatches (style wise) in your software stack.\n",
    "- Hold brown bag sessions during lunch (or similar) to help your team/organization understand or aren't fluent with the FPT patterns approach.\n",
    "- Expanding your knowledge to FPT will help you understand and extend other libs, such as `click`. Having a solid understanding of FPT will provide you with one more tool in help you express yourself in code.\n",
    "- Find specific examples in your application or code base where you're having composiblity issues with OO patterns and investigate using a FPT design. Be sure to discuss composibilty improvements as well as (hopefully) reduced cognative overhead of the code base.\n",
    "- In FPT you're often going to have a lot of small functions, **consistent naming conventions** are extremely important. Perhaps even more so than in OO design. ([Obligatory naming is hard discussion](https://hilton.org.uk/blog/why-naming-things-is-hard))\n",
    "- If you're using Python 3. Try to consistently leverage type declarations when passing around functions as arguments to other functions. \n",
